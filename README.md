This repo contains an 'Affirmations App', which displays a list of encouraging messages(or quotes!) 
that ou can read o start off your day on a positive note.

Through this app, I was able to gain a solid foundation in the following areas:
 - Creating a material design card using Jetpack Compose.
 - Creating a scrollable list using Jetpack Compose using the 'LazyColumn' composable.
 - Modify the UI contained within a Card composable.
 - Building a list using custom list items.
